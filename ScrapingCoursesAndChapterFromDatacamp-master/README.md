Searching datacamp course becomes increasing important step for me to learn grasp practical skills and fimiliarize new fields. This is a major differentiator, at least I think, from other MOOC platforms like Courses and Edx.

# Why scrape datacamp?
One thing datacamp search engine cannot provide is I cannot search for some topics embeded in one whole course. Sometimes Google is handy if you know a little bit about SEO and advanced search tools. The alternative is scaping evey chapters or even modules from every class. That's what this spider is doing.

# How to implement?
The process is easy and handy:

1. Run firstSpider.py file
2. Run outputCsv.py file

# What you need to offer and what you get? 
## Input
The link to the [main course page of Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/all)
![Datacamp page preview](https://github.com/BrandonJia/WebScraping/blob/master/ScrapingCoursesAndChapterFromDatacamp-master/Capture.PNG)
## Output 
After several seconds, a CSV file named datacampCourses.csv which includes all courses offered by Datacamp and their chapters.
[Here is the results](https://github.com/BrandonJia/WebScraping/blob/master/ScrapingCoursesAndChapterFromDatacamp-master/datacamp_courses.csv)
